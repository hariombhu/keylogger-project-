# keylogger-project-

Project Description

This project is a Python Keylogger developed using the pynput library. It serves as a functional tool for monitoring and logging keystrokes on a system in real time. The keylogger efficiently handles both character and non-character keys and produces a clean output log that accurately reflects user input. Below is an overview of its core functionality and purpose:

Core Features:

Key Mapping:

Maps special keys (e.g., Enter, Backspace, Space) to readable text such as [enter] or [space] for better clarity in the output.
Retains all alphanumeric characters as they are typed.
Backspace Handling:

Implements a custom backspace function that deletes the last recorded character from the log file whenever the Backspace key is pressed.
Output File:

Logs all keypresses to a file named KeyLog.txt. The file maintains an organized and clean record of input.
Real-Time Key Press Detection:

Uses a listener to capture keystrokes as they occur and appends them to the log file dynamically.
Purpose:
This project demonstrates how keylogging functionality can be implemented using Python for educational and ethical learning purposes. It can also serve as a foundational base for projects that require keypress tracking, such as automated testing, debugging, or user interaction analysis.

Applications:

Educational Use:
Understand the basics of keylogging and how to interact with hardware input using Python.
Debugging Tools:
Extend this to create tools for monitoring input during software testing.
Notes:

Ethical Use:
This project is intended solely for educational purposes or authorized use.
